This document describes the product vision behind MinningBots from a functional and user-oriented perspective.  
It focuses on the problem the product aims to solve and the value it provides to organizations.

## The problem

Many organizations store critical information across multiple documents such as PDFs, manuals, procedures, and internal reports. As this information grows, finding specific answers becomes time-consuming and inefficient.

Employees often need to:
- Search through multiple files  
- Ask colleagues for help  
- Rely on outdated information  
- Use external tools that may compromise data privacy  

This creates delays, frustration, and potential security risks.

## The idea behind MinningBots

MinningBots was envisioned as a tool that allows organizations to interact with their internal documents using natural language, in a way that feels simple and intuitive.

Instead of searching manually, users can ask questions and receive:
- Clear answers  
- Information grounded in their own documents  
- References to the source document and page  

The goal is not to replace documents, but to make them easier to access and understand.

## Target users

The product was designed with non-technical users in mind, such as:
- Administrative staff  
- Operations teams  
- Support and internal service teams  
- Managers who need quick access to information  

The focus was on usability and clarity rather than technical complexity.

## Core principles

The vision of MinningBots is guided by the following principles:

- **Security first**: documents remain inside the organization’s environment  
- **Clarity**: answers should be easy to understand and verifiable  
- **Efficiency**: reduce the time spent searching for information  
- **Transparency**: always show where the information comes from  
- **Simplicity**: interfaces and interactions should be intuitive
