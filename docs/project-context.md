This document provides context about how the MinningBots project was approached and how the team worked together.  
It focuses on the collaboration process, product perspective, and practical organization of the project rather than technical implementation details.

## Project background

MinningBots started as a collaborative project between a small group of teammates with the idea of building an AI assistant that could help organizations access information from their internal documents in a simple and secure way.

The initial focus was on companies in Peru and Chile, where many organizations manage large volumes of internal documentation and need fast access to information without exposing sensitive data to the Internet.

## How the team worked

The project was developed in an informal and collaborative environment. Roles were not formally assigned, and tasks were distributed based on availability and individual strengths.

Team discussions were used to define ideas, clarify features, and align on what the product should do. As part of the collaboration, I usually documented agreements and decisions to keep clarity and continuity, especially when requirements evolved or new ideas appeared.

This approach was influenced by my previous experience working in operational and coordination roles, where documenting agreements and actions was essential.

## Focus on product and organization

From a product perspective, the goal was to keep the system simple, understandable, and useful for non-technical users.

Key points that guided the project included:
- Secure handling of internal documents  
- Clear and reliable answers based on uploaded files  
- Transparency about where answers come from (document and page)  
- Easy-to-use interfaces  
- Practical demos that reflected real use cases  

These points were discussed and refined collaboratively throughout the project.

## Documentation approach

Documentation in this project was practical rather than formal. Most documents and notes were created to:
- Support team discussions  
- Prepare demos and presentations  
- Clarify expectations  
- Help explain the product to non-technical stakeholders  

This file is part of an effort to organize and summarize that material in a clear and accessible way.
