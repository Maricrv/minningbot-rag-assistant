# Demos and Communication – MinningBots

This document summarizes the activities related to demos, presentations, and product communication carried out during the MinningBots project.

These activities were focused on explaining the product to non-technical audiences, supporting discussions with potential clients, and clearly communicating the value of the solution.

## Demo preparation

As part of the project, I prepared several demos to show how MinningBots worked from a user perspective.

Demo preparation typically included:
- Selecting representative documents  
- Preparing example questions  
- Reviewing expected responses  
- Ensuring the demo flow was clear and easy to follow  

The goal of these demos was not to show technical details, but to demonstrate how the product could be used in real scenarios.

## Demo videos

To support demos and product explanations, I created and recorded demo videos that showed:

- Uploading documents  
- Asking questions  
- Reviewing answers and document references  
- Navigating the main features of the system  

These videos were used as support material for presentations and early conversations with potential clients.

## Product presentations

I prepared product presentations using Canva to explain:

- The problem MinningBots addresses  
- The main features of the solution  
- The value for organizations  
- Example use cases  

Presentations were created primarily in Spanish, as the initial target market was Peru and Chile, and later adapted to English for broader communication.

## Product landing page

As part of the communication efforts, I also created and customized the MinningBots product landing page:

https://minningbots.com/

The site was built using an online template and adapted to include:
- Product description  
- Feature overview  
- Deployment options  
- Demo-oriented messaging  

The landing page served as a central point to share presentations, videos, and product information.

## Communication approach

The overall communication approach focused on clarity and accessibility.

Key principles included:
- Avoiding technical jargon  
- Explaining the product in simple terms  
- Highlighting practical benefits  
- Supporting explanations with demos and visuals  

This helped ensure that the product could be understood by both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Notes

The materials described in this document were created to support communication and understanding of the product rather than formal marketing campaigns.

They reflect a practical, hands-on approach to explaining the solution and its value.
